All unknown temperatures close to any of the boundaries (left, right, top, bottom) will be influenced by the prescribed and known temperatures from the wall via the 5-point stencil. Prescribed values do not have to be calculated and can therefore be moved to the right hand side of the equation, and by doing so we modify the numerical stencil in that specific discretized point.
